;;; Commentary:


;; undo-propose.el is a package for navigating through your undo history
;; in a temporary buffer.

;; To use undo-propose, call "M-x undo-propose" in the buffer you are editing.
;; This will send you to a new temporary buffer, which is read-only except
;; for allowing `undo' commands.  Cycle through the list of undo's as normal.
;; When you are finished, type "C-c C-c" to add the chain of undo's as a
;; single edit to the undo history.  To cancel, type "C-c C-k".  You can also
;; ediff the proposed chain of undo's by typing "C-c C-d".

;;; Code:

(defvar undo-propose-parent nil "Parent buffer of undo-propose buffer.")
